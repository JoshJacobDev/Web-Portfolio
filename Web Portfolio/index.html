          <h3>Hi, I'm Josh! Nice to meet you!</h3>
          <p>I'm a software developer who's still got a lot to learn, and I'm better off for it. That just means I still have a lot more room to grow! I'm currently living in Las Vegas, Nevada with the love of my life and our son Kota, the cutest Pomsky puppy you'll ever see.</p>

            <li>Video games (I've been gaming since I was only 3 years old)</li>
            <li>Comedy (How else are you supposed to get through life?)</li>
